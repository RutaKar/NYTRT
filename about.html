       <h2> 
<p>I wanted to created a website that would allow a user to contrast Russia Today (RT) and New York Times headlines. Russia Today is famously known to be ‘Vladimir Putin’s global disinformation service’ or ‘continuation of the old Soviet propaganda services.’ RT is prone to coverage slanted against "the West" in general and the social injustices in United States barely covering news in Russia. When RT does cover Russian news it always presents a positive view of Kremlin and state policies. This is why I wanted a user to be able to see and juxtapose the biased views of RT with the more objective headlines from New York Times. Also, I think that creating such website directly links to what Nate Harrison discussed in his essay on Mashups, it allows the user to access dynamic, new and transformed information creating a new use for a pre-existing purposes of certain databases.  </p>


<p>The process of creating this website began by looking for the APIs for NYT and RT. The one challenge I faced was that NYT has an open source API while RT does not. Finding a way to find an API that would offer RT data took a little bit of research but I managed to find News API source that offers access to different news website APIs. Another challenge was the technical aspects of the website and making it work correctly. I have used different resources such as professor’s Mashup class sample codes and Ajax code examples found on Github. For HTML and CSS I used code examples in W3 Schools. Besides that I also used Google APIs for styling. I wanted the design to be minimalistic and I wanted the user to focus on the juxtaposed headlines. I wanted it to be clear which headline was RT and NYT that it is why I used images of each news agency and color coordinated the headlines using green for RT and black for NYT. </p>


<p> In the future, I would like to make a more complex site that in addition to headlines uses short summaries, publishing dates, popularity of the article and images. I also want to find away to allow user to pick the news sites that she/he could compare, allowing the experience to be more personal and interactive. </p>
